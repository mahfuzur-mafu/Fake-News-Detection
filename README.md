# Fake News Detection
  
# Objective 
The aim of this work is to create a system or model that can use the data of past news reports and predict the chances of a news report being fake or not. 

# Motivation 

• Real life Project.

• Huge amount of population can use this system.

• Implementing machine learning using pandas, NumPy, sklearn module.

• Gaining new experiences.


# Steps to perform for fake news detection

• load dataset.

• Spilt dataset into manual testing and train.

• Concate manual testing and traing dataset. 

• Text convert into vectors.

• Model implementation With Accuracy.


# Algorithm 

• Logistic Regression  

• Decision Tree Classification

• Random Forest Classifier

# Data Visualization and demo
